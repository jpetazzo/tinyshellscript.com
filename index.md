## Hi! I'm Jérôme Petazzoni.

I am a software engineer and
speaker offering training and consulting services in the
fields of containers, orchestration, and developer
relations.

If you would like to work together or have me speak at
your conference or event, please
[get in touch](mailto:jerome.petazzoni@gmail.com)!

## Training

I build and maintain course materials covering topics like
containers, Docker, Kubernetes.

I regularly deliver public and private training using
these materials, often adapting them to better serve
my clients.

I'm based in the US and I visit Europe frequently.
I can deliver training and workshops anywhere in the
world. My training materials are in English, but I
can deliver them in English or French (my native language).

## Speaking

If you'd like me to talk at your conference or event,
[email me](mailto:jerome.petazzoni@gmail.com) to discuss
how I can get involved.
*Please note that I will expect you to cover at least
my travel expenses, and depending on the type of your
event, to compensate me for my time. Thank you!*

## About me

I've worked for various startups in France and in the US. I was part of the team that built, scaled, and operated the dotCloud PAAS, before that company became Docker. I worked 7 years there, during which I managed a team of Site Reliability Engineers responsible for hundreds of EC2 instances running tens of thousands of containers, wrote many tutorials and documentation, fostered the Docker community and ecosystem, delivered hundreds of talks at meetups and conferences all around the world, and trained thousands of engineers to leverage Docker, containers, and now Kubernetes.
