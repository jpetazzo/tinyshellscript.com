## Training

I regularly deliver public and private training, as
well as workshops and tutorials at conferences like
O'Reilly Velocity, QCON, PyCon, and many others.

You can see my next scheduled public sessions, as well
as a number of training materials, on
[container.training](https://container.training/).

In the past, I've taught Python, Linux system programming,
networking, system administration. These days most of
my training engagements revolve around containers, Docker,
and Kubernetes.

### Docker and containers

I will address the needs of your team, whether you
need a half-day intro-level workshop or an extensive
3-day training including deep dives on container
internals like namespaces and cgroups.

Curious? Here are a few resources:

### Orchestration and Kubernetes

My Kubernetes curriculum is designed to be useful to
both new and existing Kubernetes users.
It is continuously updated to the latest Kubernetes
version, and extended to include the newest trends and
tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

My content is designed to be adapted to various lengths
and audiences. Here are a couple of examples of
detailed curriculums:

- [20-hour Kubernetes Bootstrap](kubernetes-online.html)
  specifically adapted for online/remote learning,
  suitable for all audiences (dev, ops, architects)
  with basic knowledge of containers

- [2-day Kubernetes Bootstrap](kubernetes-bootstrap.html)
  suitable for all audiences (dev, ops, architects)
  with basic knowledge of containers

- [4-day Kubernetes Administrator Training](kubernetes-ops-week.html)
  covering Kubernetes basics + everything you need to know
  to operate Kubernetes clusters
